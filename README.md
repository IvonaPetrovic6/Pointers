# Pointers
working with pointers in C programming language

In main function there are two pointers (str1 and str2).
This two pointer variables are the arguments of function zamjena (what means replacement, because in that function the values of variables to which str1 and str2 point, are replaced with each other.
At the end of function zamjena text is printed on the screen: str1 is Text2
                                                              str2 is Text1
